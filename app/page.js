   * When we visit a page for the first time by, for example, manually entering the URL(my-page.come/about),
   * then indeed it's rendered on the server,we get the finished page, and we're here.
   * But if we are on a page and we then navigate around by clicking links, for example,NextJS allows us to actually stay in a single-page application
   * and update the UI with help of client-side JavaScript code.Now, technically the content of the Next page will still be pre-rendered on the server,
   * but it will then be updated on the client side with client-side JavaScript code(finished page(required page) will be served qhwn we will visit the page for 1st time.). */
